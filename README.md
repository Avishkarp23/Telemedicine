# Telemedicine
Telemedicine is the use of technology to serve medication as rural and far away places remotely where availability of proper physicians and doctors are not available 
this project is a python based bot which takes symptoms from users of how the patient is feeling and predicts the disease .After prediction of the disease it displays the medicines recommanded by doctors and then finally it redirects to hospital form if user validates
